# Picto-Lite

Create and share nonograms [in the browser](https://ilknarf.github.io/picto-lite)! Created using React.

Uses CSS Grid to create a playable nonogram board. 

Try to click and drag when playing or building! Special considerations were made
for intuitive drag behavior, which is tracked through React context.

Board data is stored via hex string.
